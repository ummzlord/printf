.SH NAME
_printf -- formatted output
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf format [arguments, ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf is a variadic function that produces a string according to a
.I format
and prints it to the standard output, much like the C standard library function printf. It can receive a variable number of arguments.
This function has been created in the context of a project for ALX AFRICA.
_printf parses the format string and replaces specifiers with variadic arguments.
